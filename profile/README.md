# Hi there 👋

*[figuren.theater](https://figuren.theater/)* (is the|will be a) plattform, that shows:

1. actual content of people doing puppetry in austria, germany and switzerland.
2. that it is not necessary to have thoose artists do regular and unpayed copy & paste work, to publish their content to such a plattform and keep it updated

## How it started

Read how the [crew](https://figuren.theater/crew/) started the idea, that powers *this* github organization and all of its repos, in their first blog-post *[Wie alles begann](https://meta.figuren.theater/blog/2020/03/wie-alles-begann/)*, published 2020 in german.
